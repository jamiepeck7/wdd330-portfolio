    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <h3>Things to remember--</h3>
    
    <h4>Chapter 8-Forms</h4>
    <li>a form element contains controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons</li>
    <li>document.forms returns and HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the orderthey appear in markup</li>
    <li>const input = form.searchInput or const input = form['searchInput']</li>
    <li>forms are the main way to enter data into a browser</li>
    <li>document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page</li>
    <li>form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form</li>
    <li>a submit event can be used to stop a form before its been submitted</li>
    <li></li>

    <h4>Chapter 12-Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h4>
    <li>Encapsulation- inner workings are kept inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user, 
      such as the "on" button.
    </li>
    <li>Polymorphism-same process can be used for different objects</li>
    <li>Inheritance-taking the features of one object then adding some new features. Take an object that already exists and improve it by 
      adding new properties and methods. 
    </li>
    <li>Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.</li>
    <li>Class declarations that use class keywords can be used in place of constructor functions</li>
    <li>Inside of a constructor function is a class declaration, the keyword "this" refers to the object returned by the function</li>
    <li>All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of protoype</li>
    <li>The prototype is live. The prototype chain can be used to find a method.</li>
    <li>Private properties and methods can be created by defining varaiables using <i>const</i> and defining a function inside a constructor fucntion</li>
    <li>Monkey-patching is adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their protoypes. can cause unespected behavior in way objects work.</li>
    <li>Mixin method is used to add properties and methods from other objects without creating an inheritance chain</li>
    <li>Methods can be borrowed from other objects</li>
    <li></li>

    <h4>Chapter 25-Modern JavaScript Development</h4>
    <li>More programs you write-More lines of code you will get. Break codes into files.</li>
    <li>Javascript library provdes cods that makes it easier to achieve common tasks</li>
    <li>jQuery is most popular JavaScript library</li>
    <li>$ is used by jQuery as an alias for the jQuery object that contains all the jQuery methods</li>
    <li>_ is useful in functions</li>
    <li>"const" = constructor---why doesn't the book say this?? I learned this from my husband!</li>
    <li>JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve.

      Libraries can make programming much easier, but you should think carefully about whether you require a library, and which one is best for your needs.
      
      jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of useful and well-tested functions.
      
      npm and Yarn are package managers that can be used to install JavaScript packages, as well as any dependencies that they require.
      
      A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.
      
      ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their own self-contained files and imported into another file.
      
      The MVC pattern is used to organize code into distinct sections that are responsible for different elements of an application.
      
      Template files can be used to separate view code from JavaScript; they also enable dynamic code and programming logic to be used to generate markup.
      
      React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components and keep track of their state.
      
      Minification is the process of removing any redundant characters from the code in order to reduce its file size.
      
      Files can be compressed on the server using the gzip compression tool.
      
      Webpack can be used to bundle multiple files into a single bundle, and automate common tasks such as transpiling, minifying code and running tests.
      
      Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, minified and compressed. The script tag should be placed just before the closing </body> tag to ensure that all elements on the page have loaded before the script runs.</li>

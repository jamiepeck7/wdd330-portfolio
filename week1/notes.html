            We need to design for the smallest view first. Mobile usage has exploded and is very popular.
            If we start with the mobile first and move up it will be worth it in the end. Provides best experience. Starting
            small and scaling up makes things easier for you and the end user. Mobile is here to stay, desktops are declining.
            It is important to know your users better than they know themselves.
            Have to be there for them, make it easy-atention spans are non exisitent.
            Speed matters to the users-quick loading

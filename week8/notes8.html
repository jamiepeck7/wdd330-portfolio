    <h3>Things to remember--</h3>
    <h4>Chapter 8-Transforms and Transitions</h4>
   <li>The transform property lets you translate, rotate, scale and/or skew any element on the page. CSS3 gives you unprecedented control of many
     aspects ofthe element's appereance.
   </li>
   <li>Transform functions are ways to manipulate the element's appereance.</li>
   <li>Translation functions allow you to move the elements left, right, up or down.</li>
   <li>Translation functions are similar to position:relative when declaring top and left. Translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left,
     and y from the top. (transform: translate(45px, -45px);)
   </li>
    <li>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively. To move 45px to the right along the x axis, include:

      transform: translateX(45px);</li>
      <li>To move up along the y axis by 30px, include:

        transform: translateY(-30px);</li>
    <li>Scaling function scales and element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. Scale(x,y). Transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);</li>
    <li>Rotation-rotate() function rotates and element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.</li>
    <li>Skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);</li>
    <li>transform-orgin controls the origins from which your transforms are applied.</li>
    <li>The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis. </li>
    <li>While CSS3 transforms are unsupported in IE before version 9, you can mimic these effects with other CSS properties, including filters.</li>
     <li>steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:

      Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.
      
      Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.
      
      Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property , transition-duration , transition-timing-function , and transition-delay . We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
      <li>The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.</li>
      <li>You can provide any number of CSS properties to the transition-property declaration, separated by commas. Alternatively, you can use the keyword all to indicate that every supported property should be animated as it transitions.</li>
      <li>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state. You can specify this either in seconds ( s ) or milliseconds ( ms ).</li>
      <li>The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail. Do you want your animation to start off slow and become faster, start off fast and end slower, advance at an even keel, or some other variation?</li>
      <li>The transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins. Normally a transition begins immediately, so the default is 0 . Include the number of milliseconds ( ms ) or seconds ( s ) to delay the transition. </li>
      <li>With four transition properties and a vendor prefix, you could wind up with eight lines of CSS for a single transition. Fortunately, as with other properties such as border , there’s a shorthand available. The transition property is shorthand for the four transition properties just described.

        Let’s take another look at our transition so far:
        
        .ad-ad2 h1 span {
            transition-property: transform; 
            transition-duration: 0.2s;  
            transition-timing-function: ease-out;
            transition-delay: 50ms;
        }
        Now let’s combine all those values into a shorthand declaration:
        
        .ad-ad2 h1 span {
            transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
        }</li>
        <li>CSS Animations allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.</li>
        <li>To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element’s property declaration block. Animations in themselves don’t do anything; in order to animate an element, you’ll need to associate the animation with that element.

          To create an animation, use the @keyframes rule for IE10+ and FF16+. Include @-webkit-keyframes for all WebKit implementations followed by a name of your choosing, which will serve as the identifier for the animation. Then, you can specify your keyframes.</li>
    <h4>Chapter 12-Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h4>
    <li>Canvas is a way we can draw anything-all through Javascript</li>
    <li>You must add a canvas element to the page. "Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas" can be placed between the two elements. It will only be shown if your browser doesn't support canvas.</li>
    <li>Canvas element takes both a width and height element </li>

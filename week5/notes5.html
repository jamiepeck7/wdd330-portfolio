    <h3>Things to remember--</h3>
    
    <h4>Chapter 10-Testing and Debugging</h4>
    <li>Errors and bugs are part of programming...they are bound to happen</li>
    <li>System error-problem with system or external device. Programmer error-program contains incorrect or faulty logic. User error- user entered
      data incorrectly.
    </li>
    <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</li>
    <li>Stack trace is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occured. </li>
    <li>Warnings can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.</li>
    <li>'alert()' and 'console.log()' can be used to help see if a variable or part of code is working. Can also use
      console.trace()
    </li>
   <li>Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring
     the code every time a new feature is implemented.
   </li>

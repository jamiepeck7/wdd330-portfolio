    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <h3>Things to remember--</h3>
    <h4>Chapter 9-The Window Object</h4>
    <li>Every JavaScript environment has a global oject.</li>
    <li>The Browser Object Model(BOM) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the brower and computer screen</li>
    <li>Global variables are properties of the window object in a brower environment.</li>
    <li>alert, confirm(), prompt() are all methods of the window object and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.</li>
    <li>window.navigator object gives info about the user's browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable.</li>
    <li>window.location object provides info about the URL of current page</li>
    <li>window.history object keeps info about pages that have been visited in your session.</li>
    <li>You can open, close, resize and move windows--but be careful in doing so.</li>
    <li>window.screen object provides info about the user's screen.</li>
    <li>document.write() is and old way of writing text to the document and shouldn't be used.</li>
    <li>Cookies can be used to store small pieces of info between requests using the document.cookie property.</li>
    <li>window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a swet amount of time. Cancel it using the clearTimeout() method.</li>
    <li>window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. Stop it using clearInterval() methodl.</li>
    <li>window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be sued to produce smooth and optimized animation by using the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. Cancel it using cancelAnimationFrame() method.</li>
    <br>
    <h4>Chapter 14-HTML5 APIs</h4>
    <li>HTML5.1 is the latest of the Hypertext Markup Language. Covers a variety of technologies including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript</li>
    <li>data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.</li>
    <li>The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user's device similar to cookies but without the same storage restrictions. </li>
    <li>Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user's device, as long as the user gives permission.</li>
    <li>Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.</li>
    <li>Websockets are a new protocal for communicating over the Internet, and allow real-time, two-way communcation.</li>
    <li>Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.</li>

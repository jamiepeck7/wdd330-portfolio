    <h3>Chapter 2-Programming Basics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>//are used to make a short comment in javascript</li>
        <li>/*This is a longer comment anything here will be ignored. This is a useful place to put notes*/</li>
        <li>Javascript is made up from a series of statments-each one ends with a new line or semicolon. It is good practice to use both
          a new line and a semicolon.
        </li>
        <li>A block is a series of statements that are collected togehter inside curly braces<br>
          {const message = "hello";<br>
          console.log(message);
        }
        </li>
        <li>These are reserved words that are used by javascript and cant be used to name variables:<br>
          abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, 
          delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, 
          implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected,
           public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, 
           var, volatile, void, while, with, yield <br>
          These words should be reserved but aren't:<br>
          undefined, NaN, Infinity
        </li>
        <li>
          Primitive Data Types:
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>String</li>
          <li>Symbol</li>
          <li>Number</li>
          <li>Boolean</li>
          <li>Undefined</li>
          <li>Null</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Any value that isn't a primitive type like above is an object. These include arrays, functions, and object literals</li>
          <br>
          <li>A special operator <i>typeof</i> can be used to find out the type of value each is </li><br><br>      
          <li>Variables-used to refer to a value store in memory</li>                           
        
        
                
        
        
    </ul>

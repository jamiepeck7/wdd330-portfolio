    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <h3>Chapter 2-Programming Basics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>//are used to make a short comment in javascript</li>
        <li>/*This is a longer comment anything here will be ignored. This is a useful place to put notes*/</li>
        <li>Javascript is made up from a series of statments-each one ends with a new line or semicolon. It is good practice to use both
          a new line and a semicolon.
        </li>
        <li>A block is a series of statements that are collected togehter inside curly braces<br>
          {const message = "hello";<br>
          console.log(message);
        }
        </li>
        <li>These are reserved words that are used by javascript and cant be used to name variables:<br>
          abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, 
          delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, 
          implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected,
           public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, 
           var, volatile, void, while, with, yield <br>
          These words should be reserved but aren't:<br>
          undefined, NaN, Infinity
        </li>
        <li>
          Primitive Data Types:
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>String</li>
          <li>Symbol</li>
          <li>Number</li>
          <li>Boolean</li>
          <li>Undefined</li>
          <li>Null</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Any value that isn't a primitive type like above is an object. These include arrays, functions, and object literals</li>
          <br>
          <li>A special operator <i>typeof</i> can be used to find out the type of value each is </li><br><br>      
          <li>Variables-used to refer to a value store in memory</li>  
          <li><i>var</i>has changed to <i>let</i></li>
          <li>Scope refers to where a constant or variable is accessible by the program</li>
          <ol>Global Scope- any variable declared outside of a block. Accessible everywhere</ol>
          <ol>Local Scope-any variable defined inside a block</ol>
          <li><i>let</i>and<i>const</i>define scopes. In general, if a value is unlikely to change in your code than you shoudl delcare it 
          using const, and let should only be used for storing values that will need to be reassigned while the programis running</li>
          <li><i>length</i>tells us how many characters are n the string--name.length</li>
            <br>
            <li>Template Literals-Template literals use the backtick character, ` , to deliminate the string, as shown in the example below:</li>
            <br><li>Symbols-used to create unique values. Can only be used by using <i>Symbol()</i></li>
            <li>Numbers-can be integers(whole numbers) or floating point numbers(decimals or floats)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Quiz Ninja</h4>
      
        const question = "What is Superman's real name?"<br>
        const answer = prompt(question);<br>
        console.log(`You answered ${answer}`);<br>

      
      

      <h3>Chapter 3-Arrays, Logics and Loops</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Arrays are an ordered list of values</li>
        <li>Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain other arrays</li>
        <li>Arrays have lots of methods that can be used to manipulate items in the array</li>
        <li>Sets are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of non-duplicate values</li>
        <li>Maps are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of key-value pairs</li>
        <li>We can use an if and else statement to control the flow of code</li>
        <li>The switch statement can be used instead of multiple if and else statements</li>
        <li>A while loop and do ... while loop can be used to repeat a block of code while a condition is still true</li>
        <li>A for loop works in a similar way to a while loop, but has a different syntax</li>
        <li>A for-of loop can be used to iterate over an array</li>
        <li>Sets and maps are enumerable, so can also be looped over using a for-of loop</li>
      </ul>
        <li>**Refer to textbook for more highlighted information</li>

        <li>script</li>
          const quiz = [<br>
  ["What is Superman's real name?", "Clark Kent"],<br>
  ["What is Wonder Woman's real name?", "Diana Prince"],<br>
  ["What is Batman's real name?","Bruce Wayne"]<br>
];<br>
let score = 0 //initial score<br>
for(const [question,answer] of quiz){<br>
  const response = prompt(question);<br>
  if(response == answer){<br>
    console.log('Correct!');<br>
    score++;<br>
  } else {<br>
      console.log(`Wrong! The correct answer was ${answer}`);<br>
     }<br>
} <br>
  console.log(`Game Over you scored ${score} point${score !== 1 ? 's' : ''}`);<br>

      <h4>Chapter 4-Functions</h4>
      <li>Functions are first-class objects that behave the same way as other values.</li>
      <li>Function literals can be defined using the function declaration, or by creating afunction expressionby assigning an anonymous function to a variable.</li>
      <li>All functions return a value. If this is not explicitly stated, the function will return undefined.</li>
      <li>A parameter is a value that is written in the parentheses of a function declaration and can be used like a variable inside the functionâ€™s body.</li>
      <li>An argument is a value that is provided to a function when it is invoked.</li>
      <li>The arguments variable is an array-like object that allows access to each argument provided to the function using index notation.</li>
      <li>The rest operator can be used to access multiple arguments as an array.</li>
      <li>Default arguments can be supplied to a function by assigning them to the parameters.</li>
      <li>Arrow functions are a new shorthand notation that can used for writing anonymous functions in ES6</li>
      <li>Function declarations can be invoked before they are defined because they are hoisted to the top of the scope, but function expressions cannot be invoked until after they are defined.</li>
      <li>Acallbackis a function that is provided as an argument to another function.</li>
